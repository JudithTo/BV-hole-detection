# BV-hole-detection

A Brandt's voles hole detection method in a typical steppe ecosystem using UAS imagery and deep learning


Abstract

We proposed a novel UAS-DL-based framework that can be utilized in two representative seasons for BV hole detection. The combination of UAS and DL techniques was demonstrated to realize an automatic, accurate, and efficient BV hole detection in a typical steppe ecosystem.
